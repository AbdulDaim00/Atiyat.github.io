        <h2 class="Heading";>Our Project</h2>
    
        <p>As we know the act Atiya “عطیہ” or Donation” bears significance importance in Islam and our daily life as well. “Charity is for those in need.” is general principle which enjoins us to help people in need, be they good or bad, on the right path or not, Muslims or non-Muslims. When it comes to charitable giving, Pakistan is a generous country. About 98 per cent of people in the country give in one form or another - if not with cash, then with in-kind donations or by volunteering for needy causes. There are numerous charitable organizations operating in Pakistan as well which play a vital role in our society whose welfare services include disaster management, health services, education, orphan care, clean water, Mawakhat (interest-free loan) and other community services for the vulnerable communities of Pakistan.</p><br>
        
        <p>A study conducted by Pakistan Centre for Philanthropy shows that around 98% of Pakistanis give around Rs240 billion (more than $2 billion) annually to charity. Charity organizations play an important role in collecting donations and charities and giving back to the most deserving individuals or to welfare services. In Pakistan no doubt there are charitable organizations; there is a severe lack of trust for these organizations which is hampering their fundraising efforts. Fear of misuse, wastefulness, and lack of impact play an important role in discouraging people from donating to organizations. There is no central space or place where an individual can browse from a huge list of verified and trustable organizations and donate to the charity of his choice or to donate to a deserving individual without worrying about any kind of scam or fraudulent activity. There is also a severe lack of local platforms where an individual can start a fundraiser for his/her problems. As we have noticed, there is lack of these online crowd funding platforms that can be used to support an individual during hard times or even change one’s life; there is a space in the social media that can be filled.</p><br>
         
        
        <p>The proposed solution as described before is “Atiyat.com”. Atiya “عطیہ” or in English: “Donation/Charity”. This selfless act of giving serves the most vulnerable in society and helps ensure that peoples’ human rights and needs are met. These charities or donations can be given directly to an individual or through charitable organizations. As there are not currently crowdfunding platforms that provide a list of these organizations as well as individuals along with different kinds of welfare services and with full trust, our platform will provide all of these services with the high security and privacy to ensure that no scam or fraudulent activity occurs. To start a fundraiser especially by an individual all of the relevant details regarding their own personal information and their purpose of staring the campaign are collected in detailed form to ensure no fraudulent activity happens. The generous donors will be offered a list of charitable organizations or fundraisers started by individuals as per their desires and will make the donation process very seamless and secure. Our services will support a variety of payment method such as cash, credit or services like Easypaisa, Nayapay or Sadapay to make it feasible for every person. All the financial dealing will occur without any third party interference and/or without any breach of privacy.</p>
